# Brain-LMM
 
Code associated with the publication **A unified framework for association and prediction from vertex-wise grey-matter structure**

We have made a website version <https://baptistecd.github.io/Brain-LMM> of the repository for online browsing.

 It was made using *GitHub*, *RMarkdown* and the *EpuRate* R package (<https://github.com/holtzy/epuRate>) developed for the PCTG lab by Yan Holtz.
